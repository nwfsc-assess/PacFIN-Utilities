\title{Calculate weight from length and the weight--length relationship}
\usage{
getweight(length, sex, pars, unit.out = c("lb", "kg"), weight, unit.in)
}
\arguments{
\item{length}{A vector of fish lengths in mm.}

\item{sex}{A vector of sexes for each entry in \code{length}.
Entries must be one of the following: 'U', 'F', 'M', or 'H'.}

\item{pars}{A data frame of parameters for the weight--length
relationship as determined from empirical data. The data frame
must have columns of \code{'A'} and \code{'B'}, as well as
rows named \code{'U'}, at a minimum, \code{'F'}, and \code{'M'}.
The output from \code{\link{getWLpars}} is formatted correctly as is.}

\item{unit.out}{The desired units you wish the output to be in. See the
function call for a list of default units available within the function.
For example, \code{"lb"} would return the units of pounds.}

\item{weight}{A vector of fish weights, where the units for each
measurement are specified in \code{unit.in}.}

\item{unit.in}{A vector of units for each measurement in \code{weight}.
Options include \code{KG}, \code{G}, \code{LB}, \code{UNK}. Where, the latter leads to
the assumption that your units are in grams and will be converted
as such.}
}
\value{
A vector of measurements in the unit specified using
\code{unit.out}. If weights were provided, then the weights are also
the output. If lengths were provided, then they are converted
to weights. Where, weights are determined from lengths and weight--length
parameters input to the function.
Weights are in the same units used to calculate things, i.e., kg.

relationship parameters returned from \link{getWLpars}.
