\title{Create a state column based on input column specified in \code{source}}
\usage{
getState(Pdata, source = c("AGENCY_CODE", "SOURCE_AGID"), verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Pdata}{A data frame returned from \code{\link[=PullBDS.PacFIN]{PullBDS.PacFIN()}} containing
biological samples. These data are stored in the Pacific Fishieries
Information Network (PacFIN) data warehouse, which originated in 2014 and
are pulled using sql calls.}

\item{source}{The column name where state information is located in
\code{Pdata}. See the function call for options, where only the first
value will be used.}

\item{verbose}{A logical specifying if output should be written to the
screen or not. Good for testing and exploring your data but can be turned
off when output indicates information that you already know. The printing
of output to the screen does not affect any of the returned objects. The
default is to always print to the screen, i.e., \code{verbose = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The input data frame is returned with an additional column,
\code{state}, which is filled with two-character values identifying the state or
a three-character value \code{UNK} for all rows that do not have an assigned state.
All rows are returned, but users should pay attention to the warning that is
returned for rows that have no state id.
}
\description{
Create a categorical column that specifies which state each row is from.
}
\details{
With the creation of the comprehensive bds table in PacFIN, the column called
\code{SAMPLE_AGENCY} was deprecated; more specifically, the column is
available but filled with \code{NULL} values.
Thus, pacfintools no longer maintains \code{SAMPLE_AGENCY} that was being converted
to \code{SOURCE_AGID} and all identification of
state records should be based on \code{AGENCY_CODE} or \code{SOURCE_AGID}, where the latter is
just the converted column name (see \link{cleanColumns}).
\code{AGENCY_CODE} is a column created by PacFIN to identify which agency provided
the data. In the 2019 sablefish data there were four unique values in \code{AGENCY_CODE},
\itemize{
\item C - CDFW
\item O - ODFW
\item W - WDFW
\item M - \verb{SAMPLE_AGENCY == NMFS Tiburon} samples from 1997.
None of the \code{M} samples were in the comprehensive table as of 2021.
}

It is no longer advisable as of February 14, 2021 to create states based on
\code{PSMFC_CATCH_AREA_CODE} or \code{PSMFC_ARID} because areas are not mutually
exclusive to a state. Previous code set areas \code{1[a-z]} to Washington,
\code{2[a-z]} to Oregon, and \code{3[a-z]} to California.
The \href{https://pacfin.psmfc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PacFIN_Comprehensive_BDS_Commercial.pdf}{PacFIN documentation}
suggests that the following area codes can be assigned to the following states:
\itemize{
\item WA: 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E, 2F, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3N, 3S
\item OR: 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E, 2F, 3A, 3B, CS
\item CA: 1A, 1B, 1C
Rather than supporting one or the other, users are now left to deciphering which
PSMFC areas they want to assign to which states on there own. Hopefully, the guidance
above will be helpful. If you see the need to use PSMFC_CATCH_AREA_CODE to set states
please contact the package maintainer.
