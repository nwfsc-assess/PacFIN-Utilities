#' Pull catch data from PacFIN
#'
#' Pull catch data from the Comprehensive Fish Ticket table in PacFIN.
#'
#' @inheritParams sql
#' @inheritParams getDB
#' @template savedir
#' @param addnominal A logical, where the default, `TRUE`, adds nominal
#' PacFIN species code to `pacfin_species_code`. `FALSE`
#' leaves `pacfin_species_code` as input by the user, which will miss
#' catch for species such as dover sole that have more than one species
#' code within PacFIN, e.g., `pacfin_species_code = c("DOVR", "DVR1")`.
#' Users can also input a vector to pacfin_species_code if you want to
#' specify the species and the nominal species code without searching for
#' it. This is helpful for when you are getting data for two species and
#' you only want nominal catch for one or if you only wanted nominal catch.
#' Nominal species code will be searched for using [PullNominal.PacFIN()] if
#' the input value for `addnominal` is `TRUE`.
#' @template verbose
#'
#' @return
#' A `.RData` file is saved with the object inside the file stored as
#' `catch.pacfin`. This same data frame is also returned invisibly.
#'
#' @details
#' ## Species with special considerations
#'
#' ### URCK
#' There is a rockfish (URCK) category that consists of unassigned rockfish
#' landings. The majority of the catch is prior to 2001. Currently, there is no
#' agreed upon methodology to parsed these landing out to specific rockfish
#' species. At present, landings in this category are not included in
#' species-specific rockfish catch pulls.
#'
#' ### POP
#' In PacFIN there are four species code that can be associated with Pacific
#' ocean perch. These are POP, POP1, POP2, UPOP. The POP1 is general shelf/slope
#' rockfish and not Pacific ocean perch specific landings. These records occur
#' only in Oregon. As of the 2017 assessment, these records should be removed
#' from the catch file.
#'
#' ## Searching for species
#' Values passed to `pacfin_species_code` are searched for in their exact form.
#' That is, there are no regular expression searches so mistakes such as
#' `" POP"` will not be found. In my experiences these mistakes in the species
#' codes are more common for PacFIN species codes that are three letters rather
#' than the standard four letters.
