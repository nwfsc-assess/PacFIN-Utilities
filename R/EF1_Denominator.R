#' Calculate the denominator for the level-1 expansion factor.
#'
#' Calculate the denominator for the level-1 expansion, where the denominator
#' is the weight of all fish in the sample.
#' `EF1_Denominator` is not run by the user, it is a sub-function of
#' [getExpansion_1].
#'
#' @details
#' The denominator of the level-1 expansion factor is the weight of the sampled
#' fish in the sample unit, where for fisheries data, this unit is most often
#' the trip level because information on individual hauls is not available.
#' For a survey, tow- or haul-level data are typically available.
#' The sum of the weight in the sample is calculated different for each state
#' based on the data that are available.
#' 
#' Oregon provides information on the weight of females and males in the sample
#' via the `WEIGHT_OF_FEMALES` and `WEIGHT_OF_MALES` columns. These are often
#' model-based weights, which would be the only way they can get weights when
#' the fish were not weighed themselves. The weight of unsexed fish is calculated
#' internally by the code and added to the female and male weight.
#' **todo**: Let Oregon know that this calculation is being done and they may want
#' to provide UNK_WGT.
#' 
#' California sample weights were previously based on the column labeled
#' `SPECIES_WEIGHT`. Now, California data is parsed by PacFIN to furnish
#' species-specific cluster weights. Prior, cluster weights included the weight
#' of all species in the sample. Now, `CLUSTER_WEIGHT` is the weight in that
#' cluster for the species of interest. This was verified for dover sole by
#' Kelli F. Johnson in February of 2021. Thus, the code uses `CLUSTER_WEIGHT`
#' rather than `SPECIES_WEIGHT` now.
#' **todo**: determine if this should be the only cluster-specific value going forward?
#'
#' Washington does not pretend to provide any information regarding total weight
#' of fish in the sample. Therefore, this value is calculated by summing the
#' empirical weight of fish. For fish that were not weighed, a weight is
#' calculated given the input parameters. It is up to the user to calculate
#' these if they want them based on more data than what is included in `Pdata`.
#' Finally, for fish that have no length and therefore no predicted weight,
#' the mean of fish weight in the sample is used to assign all fish a weight.
#'
#' Another thing to note in the calculation of the denominator is that sample
#' weights are length- and age-specific values. You would not want to weight
#' an age sample based on how many lengths were measured. So, the weights of
#' fish that are not lengthed are backed out of the sample weight and the
#' weight of fish that are not aged are backed out of the sample weight to
#' create length- and age-specific sample weights. Only these specific sample
#' weights should be used going forward.

#' @template Pdata
#' @template weightlengthparams
#' @template verbose
#' @param plot A logical that specifies if plots should be created or not.
#' The default is `FALSE`.
#' @param col.weight The name of column that contains the weight of the fish
#' in kilograms. Units are important here because kilograms will be converted
#' to pounds to match other weight calculations.
#' The default is `weightkg`, which is created using [cleanPacFIN].
#' @return Additional columns are added to \code{Pdata}:
#' * `Wt_Sampled_1`: the sum of sex-specific weights within the sample.
#' * `Wt_Sampled_2`: the species-specific sample weight only provided by
#'   California in cluster weight.
#' * `LW_Calc_Wt`: individual weights predicted from the specified 
#'   length-weight relationships.
#' * `Wt_Sampled_3`: The sum of empirical weights, for those fish within a
#'   sample where this information is available, and weights calculated from the
#'   length-weight relationship. This uses the empirical data if available and
#'   fills in with the expected weight or mean-sample weight.
