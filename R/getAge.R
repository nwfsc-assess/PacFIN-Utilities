#' Get age information for each fish
#'
#' Get age information for each fish, or row of the data. This functionality was
#' originally in `cleanAges()`, moved to [cleanPacFIN()], and is now
#' compartmentalized here, but called in [cleanPacFIN()] and stored in the `Age`
#' column.
#'
#' @details
#' ## `FISH_AGE_YEARS_FINAL`
#' `FISH_AGE_YEARS_FINAL` is defined in PacFIN as the ``age of specimen (best
#' age or final age)''. If `FISH_AGE_YEARS_FINAL` does not have an entry, where
#' this should be the best age available, then the user is warned that they
#' should potentially look at the age reads from an individual reader, e.g.,
#' `age1` or `age2`, until the state works out what age read is best and
#' provides this in `FISH_AGE_YEARS_FINAL`.
#'
#' How `FISH_AGE_YEARS_FINAL` is determined can be unclear because it does not
#' always equal the value from one of the age readers. How the value is
#' determined is specific to the lab that conducted the ageing. Sometimes,
#' reconciling multiple age reads to determine the best age will lead to the
#' final age not equaling any of the individual age reads. For example, readers
#' can get together to determine the best read. We assume that those who
#' populated the column know what they are doing; but, please feel free to
#' report errors in PacFIN to GitHub issues or the package maintainer after
#' contacting the state representative.
#'
#' Ageing methods listed in keep (or derivatives of those) will be used to
#' filter for ages that are of desired method. Any age that was not estimated
#' using one of the desired methods will be replaced with an `NA`.
#'
#' ### Deprecated methods
#' Previously, `getAge()` averaged over multiple reads if there was no entry in
#' `FINAL_FISH_AGE_IN_YEARS`. This functionality has since been removed from the
#' package starting with version 0.2.6.
#'
#' ### Washington
#' Washington uses the following order of operations to assign the best age
#' given there are multiple reads. See [issue
#' #49](http://www.github.com/pfmc-assessments/PacFIN.Utilities/issues/49) for a
#' semi-detailed discussion. Note, that they will never report more than three
#' reads because that is the limitation of their database.
#' * age1 if only one read;
#' * randomly chosen age between age-read 1 and age-read 2 if the difference
#'   between the two reads is less than or equal to three;
#' * if the difference between two reads is more than three, then the best age
#'   is manually keyed in from that designated by a human;
#' * if three reads are equal, then the value is automatically assigned; and
#' * if there are three reads and they are not equal then an age reader must
#'   choose the final value.
#'
#' ### Oregon
#' Oregon employs a single age reader, or at least has since 2014. Twenty
#' percent of first reads are re-read by the same reader but without knowing any
#' information about the results of the first read.
#' * age1 if only one read;
#' * age1 if age1 and age2 agree;
#' * age3 if age1 and age2 do not agree, where age3 is not a blind read and the
#'   reader knows the values reported in age1 and age2 when reading the otolith
#'   for a third time.
#'
#' ### California
#' Ageing of otoliths collected in California is performed by the Cooperative
#' Ageing Project, funded through a grant with the Pacific States Marine
#' Fisheries Commission. This same lab also ages the samples collected on the
#' coast-wide surveys as well as some of the samples collected by Oregon when
#' there are too many ages to read for their single age reader.
#' * age1 if only one read;
#' * age1 if age1 and age2 agree;
#' * for younger fish, i.e., less than or equal to age 10, discrepancies can
#'   normally be resolved by looking at the otolith and having knowledge of both
#'   previous reads;
#' * for older fish, i.e., older than age 10, discrepancies are resolved and the
#'   resolved age is used;
#' * for older fish where the discrepancy cannot be resolved, age1 is used
#'   because it had the freshest otolith and potentially used the better half.

#' @param keep A vector of strings, integers, `NA`, and empty strings (e.g.,
#'   `""`) representing the `AGE_METHOD`s you want to keep. All entries will be
#'   converted to character values using [codify_age_method()]. To keep the best
#'   age for a given row, at least one of the ageing methods needs to have been
#'   performed using one of the methods present in this argument. Often, it is
#'   helpful to run [getAgeMethod()] on the relevant data prior to running this
#'   function to see what age methods are currently present.
